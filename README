Included Files:

	- server.cpp
	- dijkstra.cpp
	- dijkstra.h
	- heap.h
	- MakeFile
	- README

Running instructions:

	- Type make server into the terminal to compile the files
	- If successful type ./server <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE> to run code where INPUT FILE/OUTPUT are the desired files with the desired data
	  (for our testing purposes we used test00-input.txt and mysol.txt)

Wiring instructions

	- NONE

Notes and Assumptions
	
	- The readGraph function was altered from our Weekly Exercise #5, but now we are processing the lat and lon data but still not the names
	- The dijkstras function developped was based off of pseudocode from eclass slides
	- The point struct was taken from the template code given on eclass
