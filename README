Included Files:

	- server.cpp
		-Contains code for reading and wrting to files
	- dijkstra.cpp
		-Contains code for the dijkstras algorthim
	- dijkstra.h
		-Basic header file
	- heap.h
		-basic header file
	- MakeFile
		-Includes the ability to type make and creat the program
	- README
		-this file you are currently reading, tell you about what the other files do
	-digraph.cpp
		-File containg code for a directed graph
	-diagraph.h
		-BAsic header file
	-widgrgah.h
		-Alters digraph to make it have weights
	-edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
		-File containg the data to build a weighted graph. We didn't know if we needed to include this or not so we included
		it thinking we had to include it

Running instructions:

	- Type make server into the terminal to compile the files
	- If successful type ./server <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE> to run code where INPUT FILE/OUTPUT are the desired files with the desired data
	  (for our testing purposes we used test00-input.txt and test01-input.txt and mysol.txt)

Wiring instructions

	- NONE

Notes and Assumptions
	
	- The readGraph function was altered from our Weekly Exercise #5, but now we are processing the lat and lon data but still not the names
	- The dijkstras function developped was based off of pseudocode from eclass slides
	- The point struct was taken from the template code given on eclass
